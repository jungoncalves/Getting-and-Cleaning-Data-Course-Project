## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==================================================================
 
Using the dataset 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset', create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Submission: 

- 1 - A tidy data set as described below
- 2 - A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
- 3 - A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
